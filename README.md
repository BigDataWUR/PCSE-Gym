### Introduction
CropGym is a highly configurable [Python Open AI gym](https://gym.openai.com/) environment to conduct Reinforcement Learning (RL) research for crop management. CropGym is built around [PCSE](https://pcse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a well established python library that includes implementations of a variety of crop simulation models. CropGym follows standard gym conventions and enables daily interactions between an RL agent and a crop model.

### Code 
Source code is available at [github](https://github.com/BigDataWUR/PCSE-Gym).

### Instructions
A use case is built for nitrogen fertilization in winter wheat. A Jupiter notebook (Google Colab) can be found [here](https://github.com/BigDataWUR/PCSE-Gym/blob/master/notebooks/nitrogen-winterwheat/results_paper.ipynb).
