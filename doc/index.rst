CropGym: a Reinforcement Learning Environment for Crop Management
-----------------------------------------------------------------

CropGym is a highly configurable `Python Gymnasium <https://gymnasium.farama.org/>`__ environment to conduct Reinforcement
Learning (RL) research for crop management. CropGym is built around
`PCSE <https://pcse.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__, a well established
python library that includes implementations of a variety of crop
simulation models. CropGym follows standard gym conventions and enables
daily interactions between an RL agent and a crop model.
